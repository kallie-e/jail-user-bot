# Discord "Jail User" Bot

## Overview

In a Discord server, sometimes you just wanna give someone a hard time ‚Ä¶ like putting someone in a virtual jail.  It‚Äôs a great way to blow off steam, and it can be downright hilarious for all involved and all who witness the event. 

There is currently a Discord bot that does this, but a) the jail feature is one of a vast array of features, and there are some NSFW features included in the bot, and b) as a dedicated focus to the bot, putting someone ‚Äúin jail‚Äù opens the doors to a wide variety of possibilities. While the initial concept has its advantages, I‚Äôd like to create my own version of the bot to allow for more creativity and variety.

## Goals
  
* To be able to jail my friends in a variety of ways. Because it‚Äôs fun.  And funny.  And variety is the spice of life. 
* To have fun at someone else‚Äôs expense. I wouldn‚Äôt love you if I didn‚Äôt haze you.  üòâ
