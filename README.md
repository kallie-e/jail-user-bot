# Discord "Jail User" Bot

The code is (loosely) based off of the "Discord bot example" by Thomlom, and can be found here:

## Overview

In a Discord server, sometimes you just wanna give someone a hard time … like putting someone in a virtual jail.  It’s a great way to blow off steam, and it can be downright hilarious for all involved and all who witness the event. 

There is currently a Discord bot that does this, but a) the jail feature is one of a vast array of features, and there are some NSFW features included in the bot, and b) as a dedicated focus to the bot, putting someone “in jail” opens the doors to a wide variety of possibilities. While the initial concept has its advantages, I’d like to create my own version of the bot to allow for more creativity and variety.

## Goals

To be able to jail my friends in a variety of ways: Because it’s fun.  And funny.  And variety is the spice of life. 
To have fun at someone else’s expense: I wouldn’t love you if I didn’t haze you.  😉

## Feature List

1. !jail <user> <option> places a user in jail
2. !jail <user> <option> will decorate bars and or profile pic ... effectively placing user in jail, but decoratively
